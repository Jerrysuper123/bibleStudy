# Syncretism Warning
Syncretism is the combination of different forms of belief or practice.

`
3 He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. 4 As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been.
...
9 The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord’s command. 11 So the Lord said to Solomon, “Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.
`

Syncretism is a form of adultery as well, where you are blending worldly idols with god. Just like Soloman, in human's eyes, he has been pursuing God by building god's temple for 7 years. However, he has been building his own palace for 14 years.
He has all the wealth and all the women in the world. Full of wisdom, but led a pitiful old years, where he finds everything empty under the sky. In the end, his kingdom is divided into two states.

Most Christians or people in the world are pursuing syncretism - one leg in the world and another in the kingdom. They interpret the bible in their own beliefs and thinking, but this is against god. We do not add or subtract anything from god's words.

This means when you have great progress and success in the world. You tend to forget who God is. It is very dangerous.

# Christians must be thick-faced to face Satan's accusations
Even though it is hard to have a pure heart to follow god in this world, by our flesh we cannot. But when we gave up ourselves, and follow god, holy spirits then could come in and fill in us with god's love. Then we could do it together with god.
