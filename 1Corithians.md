7 So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.
```
Do not be dismayed when you tried to spread the good news to people around you.
- you could be the one planting
- or the one waters the plant, but not seeing any growth at all
- Continue to water or plant
- Because ultimately it is God who makes things grow
- HE in heaven will know that you have been a faithful servant

10 By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. 11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
```
Christ is the only foundation in one's life, nothing else.
One's life will be tested with fire to reveal the true foundation.
When my wife's sick, I have been more focusing on her and her healing instead of god; this actually backfires:
1. The growth of my relationship with god has been stalled
2. There are tensions between my wife and me
3. Because I have been trying to interfere in her's learning with god, instead of focusing on my learning with god
4. Each has their own learning to do, neither should I judge nor wake up someone from god's planned learning path

So each day focus on godly relationship and your own learning.
The best servant/leader is someone who manages theirselves well and this could only be done through christ. I meant who could manage a team of sinners...
- the greatest influence you could have on others is through what you said or do
- you words or actions are a mirror reflection of whether Christ is in you

18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”[a]; 20 and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”

3 I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself. 4 My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. 5 Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.

8 Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have begun to reign—and that without us! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you! 
```

```
 10 We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored! 11 To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless. 12 We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it; 13 when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment.
