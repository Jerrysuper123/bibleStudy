# Lending money to family/friends is a sensitive issue. what does the bible say about it?

`Proverbs 22:7 reads, “The borrower becomes slave to the lender.”`
- Lending money can hurt a relationship. That is also why Warren Buffet never lends money to his daughter for house renovation, even though it is a small amount for him.
- Even if you kindly wanted to forget the loan to that person, he/she will always have the guilt in them, making them avoiding you in life.

`Deuteronomy 15:8 says, “You shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need, whatever it may be.” Matthew 5:42, Jesus says, “Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.”`
- The above Scriptures imply a couple of things:
- First, there must truly be a need. And second, that lending the money would actually help the borrower and not simply allow that person to make more unwise financial decisions.

In most cases, if someone periodically borrow money from others, that person has no actual needs here. Instead, she/he actually needs to review/change his lifestyle or spending habits.
- If someone is working hard in his job/business, he would not need to periodically borrow money from others.
- It is sign that they are periodic borrowers if he/she keep overpromising e.g. they will return you next week. The money is never returned next week.
- In many instances, they would use one lie after another to cover up; you simply do not know what is going on on their sides.
- Then you see their lavish lifestyle on social media e.g. multiple trips to Asia and Europe

`Trust humans but not sinful human nature`
- When your closed ones wanting to borrow money from you, your feelings could just cloud your judgement.
- You might think he/she is such a good relative. But this is just at the surface, you really do not live with them and do not know their lifestyles.
- I think best not to lend money to someone closed to you, but giving them as a gift.
- Not just money loss, it can really disappoint/hurt you when the other person keep betraying your trust and is full of lies.
- Well, it is a small price to learn such a good lesson and find out who they really are.
- There are some some cases when people return your money, and that actually strengthened the relationship due to increased trust. But this is actually a rare case.

`You also have to be sure that lending the money will actually help the borrower. Here are some questions to ask yourself:`
- Can the borrower repay the loan? 
- what shape will you be in if the money isn’t repaid? If you can’t afford to lose it, you can’t afford to lend it.
- Then ask, can you help in another way? If the person needs money to repair a car for example— could you give rides to work until they’ve saved enough for repairs?
- And last, ask yourself, can you make the money a gift instead of a loan? That way you’re not expecting it to be paid back, so you can’t be disappointed and your relationship won’t suffer. 

`You should draw up agreement with that person. Trust humans but not human nature`

Finally, If you do decide to lend the money, draw up a written agreement— even if you’re lending to a family member. When something’s in writing, it clarifies things and makes it known who’s responsible for what and when.
The loan agreement should specify the amount, interest rate if any, payment structure and collateral, if any. That will help eliminate misunderstandings later on. You can find lots of promissory note templates online. Just fill in the blanks.
