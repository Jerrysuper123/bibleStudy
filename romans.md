# Do not be ashamed of the gospel
`16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.`

# human wickeness suppresses the truth, although it was revealed to people by the lord long ago
Although people knew god, they are not thankful and foolish enough to worship false gods.

`18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.`

# God gave wicked hearts to sinful desires, hidden from truth
Once someone's heart is filled with sinful desires. They exchanged the truth with a lie. Once there is a lie planted, people eventually started to worshipping someone else than god. It could be money or sexual desires or other things, all forms of idols - that takes our attention from god.

There is natural seuxal relation between husband and wife, but people turn to unnatural ones, defiling their bodies.

`24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creatorâ€”who is forever praised. Amen.
26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.`

# if you think it is not worthwhile to retain God's knowledge, god gave you a depraved heart, hidden from truth
`28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. 29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31 they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.`
